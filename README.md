# PDF to HTML & CSS conversion
### This is a work in progress project

You are checking out a mini project I got (November - 2016) while taking my Development Course and Netcraft Academy.

Although I achieved the desired visual output, there are always ways to improve and modify my code better as I progress and expand my Front End Development arsenal.

## Project Instructions
Instructions are pretty straight-forward. Take the PNG design which is displayed below (in real life it would probably be a PSD format) and convert it into a real webpage that runs on the browser. 

## Current state of the project
- Finished converting the entrie design (everything but the footer section).
  - Made a full use of the Bootstrap framework. 
  - The webpage is fully responsive, however it is static and lacks functionality (no JS).
- **Rebuilding the entire project by adopting a modular based approach**.
  - Using Sass 
  - Getting rid of the Bootstrap framework as I'd like to have a leaner code.
  - Adopting the [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) method (Scalable Modular Architecture for CSS).
  - Making use the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) naming convention method.
