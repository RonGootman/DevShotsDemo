# PDF to HTML & CSS conversion
### This is a work in progress project

You are checking out a mini project I got (November - 2016) while taking my Development Course and Netcraft Academy.

Although I achieved the desired visual output, there are always ways to improve and modify my code better as I progress and expand my Front End Development arsenal.

## Project Instructions
Instructions are pretty straight-forward. Take the PNG design which is displayed below (in real life it would probably be a PSD format) and convert it into a real webpage that runs on the browser.
